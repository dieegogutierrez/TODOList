# TODO Web App

TodoFlask is a web application built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with a variety of features including user authentication, password hashing for security, task prioritization through starring, task coloring, and filtering by time periods.

## Features

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database, enhancing the security of user accounts.

- **Task Prioritization:** Users can star tasks to mark them as important or prioritize them over other tasks.

- **Task Coloring:** Users have the option to assign different colors to tasks for better visual organization and distinction.

- **Filtering by Time:** Users can filter tasks based on various time periods such as today, this week, and all, helping them focus on tasks that need immediate attention.
