# TODO Web App

TodoFlask is a web application built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with a variety of features including user authentication, password hashing for security, task prioritization through starring, task coloring, and filtering by time periods.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in securely, ensuring their task data is private and accessible only to them.

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database, enhancing the security of user accounts.

- **Password Recovery:** Users who forget their passwords can request a password reset. A verification token will be sent to their email to verify their identity and allow them to set a new password.

- **"Remember Me" Option:** Users can choose to have their login session remembered on the device they're using, simplifying the login process for subsequent visits.

- **Task Prioritization:** Users can star tasks to mark them as important or prioritize them over other tasks.

- **Task Coloring:** Users have the option to assign different colors to tasks for better visual organization and distinction.

- **Filtering by Time:** Users can filter tasks based on various time periods such as today, this week, and all, helping them focus on tasks that need immediate attention.

- **Responsive Design:** The web app is designed to work seamlessly across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
